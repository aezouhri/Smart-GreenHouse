# Motivation

Our final project is a smart greenhouse. We wanted to create an environment for
gardening that utilized modern day technology to successfully monitor and assist in the
growth of plants. We monitored the humidity of the air, temperature of the air, temperature
of the soil, and the moisture of the soil. Using the data collected from our sensors, we are able to notify the user of the conditions of their garden. We wanted to create this system in order to help manage the waste and overall negative impact farming has on the
environment. Although our project is implemented for only a small garden, in theory, we
can utilize the system that we have created on a larger scale. During our research, we
found that about seventy percent of the water that is used in a single year is used to grow
crops, and of that seventy percent, forty percent is lost due to overwatering, poor
irrigation, and other factors [1]. With the system we have created, we are able to monitor
the environment of the plants and manage the watering of them. Using the data, provided
by our sensors we believe that we would be able to taper the effects that farming has on
the environment. Another one of our motivations for our project was to build a system that
implements and encompasses all of the concepts, ideas, and labs that we have been
taught in lecture. These include things like bluetooth, databases, and encryption.
